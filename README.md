# Newspaper-management-system
This program helps in making the process of newspaper distribution in a locality more efficient and organised. One gets to choose their desired newspapers for a particular period. Moreover , they can fix their dates of non availability in town. The program features online payment and an additional convenience of calling the collector for collecting the old newspapers in return for money. This project is a prototype and has a lot of scope for improvement.
